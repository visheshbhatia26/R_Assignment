# R Assignment
### This ```README.md``` will serve as resource that will outline all the documents in this repository. There are various other files and their description is below. 

### ``` Maize ``` and ```Teosine``` folders contain all the files with SNPs ordered in increasaing and decreasing orders of respective Maize and Teosinte species.

### The initial code was writtin the R markdown file ``` VB_Assignment.Rmd```. This was accidentally edited by one the reviewers and they pushed the changes to my original document. The pull request was accepted and some edits were made to this original document. 

### A final version ``` Final_VB_Assignment.Rmd``` was generated that included suggestions from both the reviewers. This should be the file that you should run in order to obtain the correct results. 

### ``` VB_Assignment_review_juan.Rmd``` & ``` Bhatia_Review_By_Topping.Rmd``` are two R markdown files generated by the reviewers that include suggestions to my original R markdown assignment final. 

### ```SNP_Visualisation.pdf``` , ```MissingDATA_Heterozygosity_Visualisation.pdf``` & ```Own_Feature.pdf ``` are three PDFs containing all the output data visualization plots.
